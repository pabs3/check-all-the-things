# TODO: Emacs has some Emacs Lisp checkers.
#       You could invoke Emacs in batch mode to use them.
#       There is checkdoc for checking the documentation strings in a .el file.
#       And you can syntax-check elisp by trying to byte compile it.  Flycheck does that.
#       In flycheck.el, look for *flycheck-define-checker emacs-lisp*
#       There are two.
